# Pulse

Pulse is a clientside mod for Titanfall 2 letting you view killstats using the otherwise non-functional `Stats` tab.

Currently, features include:
- displaying kills in `Pilot Weapons`
- displaying kills and most used weapon (by kills) in `Overview`

Want to know what we have planned for future updates? See [here.](https://github.com/ToneAPI/pulse/projects?query=is%3Aopen)

## DISCLAIMER

Pulse only works servers using the Tone API, view a list of them on [the webclient.](https://toneapi.github.io/ToneAPI_webclient/)

Pulse is very much a W.I.P as of right now, features may be missing/nonfunctional.
