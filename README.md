# Pulse

Pulse is a clientside mod for Titanfall 2 letting you view killstats collected by [the Tone API](https://toneapi.github.io/ToneAPI_webclient/) using the otherwise non-functional `Stats` tab.

Currently, features include:
- displaying kills in `Pilot Weapons`
- displaying kills in `Titans` tab
- mostly functional `Overview` tab

Want to know what we have planned for future updates? See [here.](https://github.com/ToneAPI/pulse/projects?query=is%3Aopen)

## DISCLAIMER

The Tone API is NOT used by every server, view a list supported servers on [the webclient.](https://toneapi.github.io/ToneAPI_webclient/)

Pulse is very much a W.I.P as of right now, features may be missing/nonfunctional.
